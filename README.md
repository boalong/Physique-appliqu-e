# Physique appliquée aux sciences sociales

This is the repository of the group of Mathieu Janin, Florian Lava and Adrien Letellier, about Kirman's article Ants, Rationality, and Recruitment (1993).

In this repository you will find our main program, which we used to get the graphics. The graphics that you will see during our presentation are stored in the folder Graphics. Finally, the functions that we built to obtain our results are located in the functions.py file.

Have a good presentation !
